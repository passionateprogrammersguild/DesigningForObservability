						## What we will cover in this talk
						- Understand the terms Health, Monitoring and Observability
						- Review the Architecture of a sytem in the context of health, monitoring, and observability
						- Examine the tools available in the Azure ecosystem
						- Apply what we have learned to an existing system

							## System Health
														
							According the the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/about/governance/constitution), health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
						</script>
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Monitoring
														
							From the [Google SRE book](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/) monitoring is defined as collecting, processing, aggregating, and displaying real-time quantitative data about a system, such as query counts and types, error counts and types, processing times, and server lifetimes.
						</script>
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Observability
														
							According to [Honeycomb](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-started/learning-about-observability/) observability is about being able to ask arbitrary questions about your environment without having to know ahead of time what you wanted to ask.

							[Estimator &#174;](https://suddath.com/news/suddath-wins-digital-edge-50-international-technology-award/) is an application primarilary used by Salespeople to estimate business moves.  The application is designed to be mobile first such that Salespeople can perform an estimate on-site.

							### [Health checks in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

							- Health probes can be used by container orchestrators and load balancers to check an app's status.
							- Use of memory, disk, and other physical server resources can be monitored for healthy status.
							- Health checks can test an app's dependencies, such as databases and external service endpoints, to confirm availability and normal functioning.
