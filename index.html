						## What we will cover in this talk
						- Understand the terms Health, Monitoring and Observability
						- Review the Architecture of a sytem in the context of observability
						- Examine the tools available in the Azure ecosystem
						- Apply what we have learned to an existing system

							## System Health
														
							According the the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/about/governance/constitution), health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
						</script>
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Monitoring
														
							From the [Google SRE book](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/) monitoring is defined as collecting, processing, aggregating, and displaying real-time quantitative data about a system, such as query counts and types, error counts and types, processing times, and server lifetimes.
						</script>
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Observability
														
							According to [Honeycomb](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-started/learning-about-observability/) observability is about being able to ask arbitrary questions about your environment without having to know ahead of time what you wanted to ask.
