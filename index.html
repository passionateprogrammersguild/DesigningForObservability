							## System Health
														
							According the the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/about/governance/constitution), health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

							## Monitoring
														
							From the [Google SRE book](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/) monitoring is defined as collecting, processing, aggregating, and displaying real-time quantitative data about a system, such as query counts and types, error counts and types, processing times, and server lifetimes.

							## Observability
														
							According to [Honeycomb](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-started/learning-about-observability/) observability is defined as Observability is about being able to ask arbitrary questions about your environment without having to know ahead of time what you wanted to ask.
